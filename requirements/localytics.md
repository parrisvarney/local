See the two tab delimited files attached:

**products.tab** = A list of product names tab delimited with categories
**sales.tab** = A list of product names tab delimited with sales amount

From this data we'd like you to answer two questions using PHP:

* What category has the highest average sales price? (Please include the average sale price)
* What is the minimum and maximum sale in the category 'Breakfast'

This comes from when someone worked at a company that made back office software for restaurants.  You can imagine the second file is a Point of Sale record for the day.
